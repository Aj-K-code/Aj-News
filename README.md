## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Node.js and npm (for local testing server, optional)

## Setup and Testing

### Quick Start (Sample Data Mode)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd news-dashboard
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Using Perplexity API (Optional)

To use the Perplexity API for real data:

1. Get an API key from [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

2. Set the API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   
   On Windows:
   ```cmd
   set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. Install the required dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

4. Run the backend script to fetch data:
   ```bash
   python backend.py
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

### Testing the Application

1. **Local Testing**:
   - Follow the steps above to run locally
   - Toggle between Healthcare and General News tabs
   - Verify that data loads correctly

2. **Without API Key**:
   - The application will automatically fall back to sample data
   - All UI elements should work correctly
   - No configuration needed

3. **With API Key**:
   - Data will be fetched from Perplexity API
   - Real-time news will be displayed
   - Files will be saved to the `data/` directory

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. To set it up:

1. Fork this repository or create a new repository with these files

2. Go to your repository settings on GitHub

3. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar

4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

5. The deployment workflow will automatically run and deploy your site

6. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

Note: The first deployment may take a few minutes. After that, the site will automatically update whenever you push changes to the main branch.

## Automatic Daily Updates

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows that automatically fetch new news data once per day and deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

### Deployment Workflow
- Automatically runs on pushes to the main branch
- Deploys the static site to GitHub Pages

### News Update Workflow
- Runs daily at 5:00 AM UTC (12:00 AM EST)
- Uses the Perplexity API to fetch healthcare and general news
- Saves the data as JSON files in the `data/` directory
- Automatically updates an index file to track available data files
- Commits and pushes the updated files to your repository

To enable automatic updates:

1. Get a Perplexity API key from [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
2. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Create a new repository secret named `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` with your API key as the value
4. The workflows will run automatically at the scheduled time

This approach ensures that:
- Only one API call is made per day (not per user visit)
- All users see the same up-to-date content
- API costs are minimized
- The dashboard loads quickly for all users
- The site works completely statically on GitHub Pages without any backend
